# scoop-bucket

Binaries for some packages in the [bucket](https://github.com/beerpiss/scoop-bucket). 
They are either here because their canonical source doesn't exist anymore, or they're 
one-off builds that I can't be bothered to put up an entire repo for.

If it's the latter, build instructions are usually available in the [wiki](https://github.com/beerpiss/scoop-bucket/wiki).
